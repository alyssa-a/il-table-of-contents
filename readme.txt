Add a flyout table of contents block. For use with the University of Illinois theme.

== Description ==

The Table of Contents block will create a list of anchor links to each heading contained on the page where the block is included. If you do not manually add html anchors to your headings, the block will set the attributes automatically.

IMPORTANT: This block is meant to be used with the University of Illinois theme as it depends on CSS variables, Bootstrap and Font Awesome included in the theme.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/il-table-of-contents` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
